# Azure Function with Multiple Output Bindings

This example `Manual Trigger` function simulates getting a result and then storing it to Azure Table Storage and Azure Storage Queue using built in output bindings. 

The output (number of faces) is written as a message to an [Azure Storage Queue](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-queues). 

In addition, the result is archived in  in [Azure Table Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-tables)
